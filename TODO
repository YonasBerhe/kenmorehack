Kenmore Hackathon

Possible Idea:

  + Allow businesses to make better decision on whether they should move to the area or not.

  + Platform to invite people work for open project assigned randomly by the City

LAB's intro:

  + Great day

  + I am a hackathon addict. For the past 2 years studying as an International Student at the States, I was able to attend more than 20 hackathons.

LAB's story:

	+ Most of them, was organized in Seattle.

  + I believe that when developers trust the area, that the area will let them in and let them be, and code, that's when innovation and all the talent will be able to grow.

  + I believe we need tools for Developers to get together. I believe if there's a dataset on people, we can group them up for project and so on, for each tier and project which the city need to be done.
		+ Match making people randomly and make them work on that project. We need more people to solve problem, no matter who they are. If they choose to enroll, then I believe Kenmore and other city as well can have their issues resovles by the developers for the people. Highschool student, College Student, so on, need to solve these problem, not problem in the book.

  + Furthermore, I think people are more willing to do something if they don't have to worry about the prior process, e.g being grouped together. I want them to be worry about the project, not the team. Team need time to build, and if they love the project, they will have people in that.
	+ However, when the city need something solved, people rarely want to solve it unless it is something necessary.
